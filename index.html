        <p><b>Fish are some of the most recognizable aquatic organisms in both freshwater and marine habitats.</b></p>
        <hr>
        <p>Fish are aquatic vertebrate animals that have gills but lack limbs with digits, like fingers or toes. Recall that vertebrates are animals with internal backbones. Most fish are streamlined in their general body form.

        </p>
        <p>The word fish is the same whether it is singular or pluralâ€”you can talk about one fish or ten fish. The word fish is used to refer to an individual fish or to a group of fish of the same species. The word fishes refers to multiple species of fish.

        </p>
    
        <p>Scientists do not always agree on what a fish is. In fact, some early scientists thought that whales and dolphins were fish. Even now, not all scientists agree on whether the hagfish should be classified as a fish.</p>
        <p>This type of disagreement is sometimes confusing, but it is not bad. Science is about new ideas and trying to answer questions. Often these questions are difficult, and often it is hard to accurately describe relationships between organisms. During the scientific process, definitions often need to be modified, and organisms are often reclassified when new information is found.</p>
